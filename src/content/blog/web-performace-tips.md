Performance is crucial for providing a great user experience. Here are some essential tips to improve your website's performance.

## 1. Optimize Images

Images often make up the majority of a page's weight. Here's how to optimize them:

- Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement lazy loading
- Serve responsive images

## 2. Minimize JavaScript

Reduce JavaScript impact with these strategies:

```javascript
// Bad
import { everything } from 'huge-library';

// Good
import { onlyWhatINeed } from 'huge-library';
```

## 3. Leverage Caching

Implement effective caching strategies:

- Browser caching
- CDN caching
- Service Workers

## 4. Critical CSS

Inline critical CSS and defer non-critical styles:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    /* Critical CSS here */
  </style>
  <link
    rel="preload"
    href="styles.css"
    as="style"
    onload="this.rel='stylesheet'"
  />
</head>
```

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an ongoing process. Start with these basics and continuously monitor and improve your site's performance.
